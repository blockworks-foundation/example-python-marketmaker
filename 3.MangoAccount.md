# ðŸ¥­ Set up a devnet Mango Account

_This section is optional - if you know what you're doing please feel free to ignore it_

Marketmaking, and buying and selling on Mango more generally, requires a Mango Account. This holds the balances of tokens you've moved to Mango as well as your current perp positions. You can create a Mango Account by running:
```
ensure-account --cluster-name devnet
```

In order to use your devnet USDC as collateral for buying and selling perps you need to move it into your Mango Account. To do this, run:
```
deposit --symbol USDC --quantity 10000 --cluster-name devnet
```

Now if you check your Mango Account balances using:
```
show-account-balances --cluster-name devnet
```

You should see something like:
```

A couple of things worth noting from this:
* The amount of devnet SOL you have has fallen to 0.96714968 SOL. Creating the Mango Account ties up some SOL for Solana's 'rent' but you can reclaim this SOL when you close your Mango Account.
* The amount of devnet USDC has grown to something like 10,000.00000013 USDC. Interest on balances in Mango Accounts is applied continuously so even the short time it has been in your account that devnet USDC has been hard at work earning interest.
