# ðŸ¥­ Mango Explorer

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

_This section is optional - if you know what you're doing please feel free to ignore it_

To get started, clone this repo to a local directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/blockworks-foundation/example-market-maker/
cd example-market-maker
```

Next, set up a Python 'virtual environment' in the '.venv' sub-directory:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

This will keep all dependencies isolated and make sure you're consistently running the proper Python executables and libraries.

Now install all the dependencies. There's really only one dependency - `mango-explorer`, a [Python package on Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/mango-explorer) - but as your project grows you may add more dependencies so it's good to start out the right way.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

`mango-explorer` has a lot of useful commands for interacting with Mango, and it's useful to add them to your `$PATH`. (The rest of this guide will assume the commands are in your `$PATH`, so if you don't do this you'll need to adapt the instructions a bit.)

If you have [direnv](https://direnv.net/) installed (it's very handy!) you need to reload the environment after the .venv directory was created:
```
direnv reload
```
**OR**

if you're not running `direnv` you can load the '.envrc' file using:
```
source .envrc
```

You should now be able to run commands from `mango-explorer` without having to specify the full path to the executable, e.g.:
```
mango-explorer-version
```
